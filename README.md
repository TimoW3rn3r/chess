# Chess

## Introduction
Classical chess game made in Ruby. It is supposed to be played inside a terminal.

The project is made to fulfill the requirements of [Ruby Final Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-ruby-final-project) under [The Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com) for Ruby on Rails path.

## How to use
The best way to use or play this game would be cloning and running the main script locally.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/TimoW3rn3r/chess
$ cd chess
$ ruby ./main.rb
```

## Live Preview
Another way would be to visit [this replit repo](https://replit.com/@TimoWerner1/chess?v=1) and running the script by hitting play button.

It is to be kept in mind that playing inside replit terminal is not as smooth as playing in local terminal because of difference in refresh frequency.

## How to play
You can move the cursor around using _arrow_ buttons in your keyboard inside the board. Then select the preferred square by hitting _Enter_ button
to move the pieces around.

## TODO
1. Add tests.
2. Add various draw situations.
3. Add option to end game by offering draw or resignation.
4. Add alternative inputs to make the game playable in mobile.
